TODO:
all - clean up, where to include (before or after include gards), follow style guides(Boost?), self documenting identifiers

Parser - make it reusable, adding delimiter setting as well as inclusive exclusive of delimiters, (al ph + 1 error), divide by zero catch

List - implement flags or exceptions for points of error(isFull), serious bug in list destructor

Expression-Evaluator - parsetable(use parse) to create expression then evaluate(expression). parsetable does not evaluate
